# Code

This folder hosts all code for a data science project. It has three sub-folders, belonging to three stages of the data science lifecycle:

1. Data acquisition and understanding
2. Modeling
3. Deployment

The first step "data acquisition and understanding" consists of two distinct tasks:

1. Data acquisition
2. Exploratory data analysis

Whereas data acquisition is about **getting** the data, exploratory data analysis is about **understanding** the data, typically through descriptive statistics and visualizations. 

In the folder structure, "exploration" is the preferred term over the much longer "data acquisition and understanding".
