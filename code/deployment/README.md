# Deployment

## Goal

Deploy models with a data pipeline to a production or production-like environment for final user acceptance.

## How to do it

The main task addressed in this stage:

**Operationalize the model**: Deploy the model and pipeline to a production or production-like environment for application consumption.

### Operationalize a model

After you have a set of models that perform well, you can operationalize them for other applications to consume. To deploy models, you expose them with an open API interface. The interface enables the model to be easily consumed from various applications, such as:

* Online websites  
* Spreadsheets  
* Dashboards  
* Line-of-business applications  
* Back-end applications  

It is a best practice to build telemetry and monitoring into the production model and the data pipeline that you deploy. This practice helps with subsequent system status reporting and troubleshooting.

## Artifacts

* A status dashboard that displays the system health and key metrics  
* A final modeling report with deployment details  
* A final solution architecture document  

## Next step

The next step in the lifecycle of the TDSP is **Customer acceptance**.
