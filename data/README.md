# Data 

This folder hosts (samples of) all data for a data science project. It has three sub-folders:

1. Raw  
2. Processed  
3. For modeling  

**NOTE: Data (raw, processed, feature sets) should NEVER be stored on GitHub**. Ensure all data file types are listed in the .gitignore file in the project root folder.
